# TacoBot
This repository is the code used for my small discord bot for a private discord server.

The main purpose of the bot is to manage share-music channels. As the name implies, the goal of the channel is to share music in them. The bot's job is to remove any messages that do not contain any music (either url to a song or a file). If the message is a song, then the bot will automatically create a discord thread for it, so people can discuss or give feedback about the song there.
