turn ShareMessageType vars into classes:

allows for removal of the second return in is_valid_share_message 
(second return is a wildcard, could be aything depending on the case)



main.py - on_delete_message - `for threat in message.channel.threads` 
    -> might become an issue since there will be an ever increasing amount of threads
    
    -> create Channel object
        -> stores all threads in dict
            -> instant lookup as opposed to looping through each time

            -> would require additional bot.events to keep up to date


- Have the bot create a youtube and spotify playlist with the shared music in it
    -> makes it easier to go through multiple songs
    -> potentially upload a shared file to youtube (unlisted) and add it to the playlist

- Keep track of songs already posted 
    -> let user know if they posted a song that has already been shared, with a link to that message
